# Local development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Requires environment variables containing the API keys for starting the server.

## Client

### Developing locally

In `client/`, run `npm install`, then `npm start` to run the app in development mode. The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for production

`npm run build` uilds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Server

In `server/`, run `npm install`. Then run `node index.js` or `nodemon index.js` to start the server
