# Knit Pattern Search Helper

Input a natural language description of what kind of knitting project you'd like to make (ie: "cozy fall sweater with a vneck"), and a list of patterns from Ravelry will be shown.

Under the hood, the inputted description is being passed through ChatGPT to generate search terms that can be sent to the Ravelry API.


### Motivation

My goal was to create a simple "Hello, World" project to get a sense of how to practice prompt engineering with the Open AI APIs.
